# Classifying_News_Articles

News articles from different sources can depict the same event differently, or do we think so?
Can we distinguish news articles according to their sources?
We wanted machines to answer this question. Will a learning algorithm be able to distinguish the source of an article.
Search queries are purposefully chosen on dividing issues, like immigration from the south border, Atlanta shootings and so on.
Ordinary topics may not help us to see the differences.
